### About Me :nerd_face: :computer:

A very passionated Software Engineer with software background, architecting, developing, delivering optimized and scalable products.

My personal-paradigm when it comes to solving problem is: try to make the complex simple, being an out-of-the-box, non-linear thinker, always trying to preview and visualize dynamic data structures and abstract algorithms.

I'm a very science/engineering guided professional, trying to explain all solutions through two perspectives: know-why, know-how.

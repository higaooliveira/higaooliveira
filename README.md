### Hi There ! :nerd_face: :computer:

My name is Higor from Brazil (:brazil:), a very passionated Software Engineer with software background, architecting, developing, delivering optimized and scalable products.

My personal-paradigm when it comes to solving problem is: try to make the complex simple, being an out-of-the-box, non-linear thinker, always trying to preview and visualize dynamic data structures and abstract algorithms.

I'm a very science/engineering guided professional, trying to explain all solutions through two perspectives: know-why, know-how. 

### Technologies
- Python
- PHP
- Magento
- Java
- Kotlin
- Javascript

In my free time I like to play videgames (:video_game:), to watch soccer (:soccer:), to watch movies (:film_strip:), to listen to music (:musical_note:) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (:beer:).

Would you like to find me?
